Aggressive Driving Analysis Pipeline

This script implements a complete pipeline for analyzing driving behavior data
and detecting aggressive driving events using anomaly detection techniques.

The pipeline consists of three main stages:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare driving data for analysis
2. Anomaly Detection: Identify abrupt changes in driving patterns
3. Event Classification: Classify detected anomalies as aggressive driving events
